# Uber Pickups ! 

One of the main pain point that Uber's team found is that sometimes drivers are not around when users need them.
Users would still have to wait 10 to 15 minutes before being picked-up, which is too long. Uber's research shows that users accept to wait 5-7 minutes, otherwise they would cancel their ride.

Uber already has data about pickups in major cities. The objective is to create algorithms that will determine where are the hot-zones that drivers should be in. 

To try this feature I will only focus on New York city. 

There are two parts: 

Part 1 : EDA 
Part 2 : Clustering to pin hot zones
